  of internal redundancy
  (`#354 <https://github.com/bluescarni/heyoka/pull/354>`__).

Fix

  This feature is opt-in due to the fact that enabling it
  can considerably increase JIT compilation times.
- Implement an in-memory cache for ``llvm_state``. The cache is used
  to avoid re-optimising and re-compiling LLVM code which has
  already been optimised and compiled during the program execution
  (`#340 <https://github.com/bluescarni/heyoka/pull/340>`__).
- It is now possible to get the LLVM bitcode of

Changes
~~~~~~~

- **BREAKING**: the minimum supported LLVM version is now 11
  (`#342 <https://github.com/bluescarni/heyoka/pull/342>`__).
  This is a :ref:`breaking change <bchanges_2_0_0>`.

  within the ``[0, 3]`` range
  (`#340 <https://github.com/bluescarni/heyoka/pull/340>`__).
- The LLVM bitcode is now used internally (instead of the textual
  representation of the IR) when copying and serialising
  an ``llvm_state``
  (`#339 <https://github.com/bluescarni/heyoka/pull/339>`__).
- The optimisation pass in an ``llvm_state`` is now automatically
  called during compilation

  copy and deserialisation of ``llvm_state``

- Fix broken link in the docs.

1.0.0 (2023-08-10)
------------------

New
~~~

  member function that will be called before the first step

- The heyoka library now passes all ``clang-tidy`` checks
  (`#315 <https://github.com/bluescarni/heyoka/pull/315>`__).

  API. These vectorised overloads allow to perform the same
  operation on a list of expressions more efficiently
  than performing the same operation repeatedly on individual
  expressions
  (`#312 <https://github.com/bluescarni/heyoka/pull/312>`__).
- The expression class is now immutable
  (`#312 <https://github.com/bluescarni/heyoka/pull/312>`__).

- New ``model`` module containing ready-made dynamical models
  (`#302 <https://github.com/bluescarni/heyoka/pull/302>`__,

Changes
~~~~~~~

- Comprehensive overhaul of the expression system, including:
  enhanced automatic simplification capabilities for sums,
  products and powers, removal of several specialised primitives
  (such as ``square()``, ``neg()``, ``sum_sq()``, etc.),
  re-implementation of division and subtraction as special
  cases of product and sum, and more
  (`#332 <https://github.com/bluescarni/heyoka/pull/332>`__,
  `#331 <https://github.com/bluescarni/heyoka/pull/331>`__,
  `#330 <https://github.com/bluescarni/heyoka/pull/330>`__,

  caching the hashes of repeated subexpressions
  (`#299 <https://github.com/bluescarni/heyoka/pull/299>`__).

  inlined, which leads to improved codegen and better performance
  (`#299 <https://github.com/bluescarni/heyoka/pull/299>`__).
- **BREAKING**: the ``make_nbody_sys()`` helper has been replaced by an equivalent
  function in the new ``model`` module
  (`#295 <https://github.com/bluescarni/heyoka/pull/295>`__).
  This is a :ref:`breaking change <bchanges_1_0_0>`.
