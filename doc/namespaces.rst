Namespaces
==========

All the functionality of the library is included within the ``heyoka`` namespace.

The ``inline`` namespace ``heyoka::literals`` contains several user-defined literals (e.g., for the creation of an expression from
a floating-point literal).

The namespace ``heyoka::kw`` contains the :ref:`keyword arguments <kwargs>` used throughout the heyoka API.
