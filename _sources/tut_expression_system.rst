The expression system
=====================

As we saw in the :ref:`previous section <tut_taylor_method>`, heyoka
needs to be able to represent the right-hand side of an ODE system in symbolic
form in order to be able to compute its high-order derivatives via automatic
differentiation. heyoka represents generic mathematical expressions
via a simple `abstract syntax tree (AST) <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree>`__
in which the internal nodes are n-ary functions,
and the leaf nodes can be:

* symbolic variables,
* numerical constants,
* runtime parameters.

Constants and parameters are mathematically equivalent, the only difference being
that the value of a constant is determined when the expression is created, whereas
the value of a parameter is loaded from a user-supplied data array at a later stage.

As a simple example, here is a graphical representation of the
AST for the expression :math:`\left( 1 - x^2\right)y-x`:

  :scale: 30%
  :align: center

Thanks to the use of modern C++ features (user-defined literals, overloaded operators, etc.),
the construction of the AST of an expression in heyoka can be accomplished via natural
mathematical notation:

.. literalinclude:: ../tutorial/ex_system.cpp
   :language: c++
   :lines: 17-24

Numerical constants can be created using any of the floating-point types supported by heyoka:

.. literalinclude:: ../tutorial/ex_system.cpp
   :language: c++
   :lines: 26-34,36-37

Note that support for extended-precision floating-point types
:ref:`varies depending on the software/hardware platform <ep_support>`.

In addition to the standard mathematical operators, heyoka's expression system
also supports the following elementary functions (with more to come in the near future):

* square root,
* exponentiation,
* the basic trigonometric and hyperbolic functions, and their inverse counterparts,
* the natural logarithm and exponential,
* the standard logistic function (sigmoid),
* the error function,
* the inverse of Kepler's elliptic equation.

heyoka also provides an API for implementing new functions without
modifying the library's code.

It must be emphasised that heyoka's expression system is not a full-fledged
computer algebra system. In particular, its simplification capabilities
are very limited. Because heyoka's performance is sensitive
to the complexity of the ODEs, in order to achieve optimal performance
it is important to ensure that
the mathematical expressions supplied to heyoka are simplified as
much as possible.
