heyoka is a C++ library for the integration of ordinary differential equations
(ODEs) via Taylor's method, based on automatic differentiation techniques and aggressive just-in-time
compilation via [LLVM](https://llvm.org/). Notable features include:

* support for single-precision, double-precision, extended-precision (80-bit and 128-bit),
  and arbitrary-precision floating-point types,
* high-precision zero-cost dense output,
* accurate and reliable event detection,
* builtin support for analytical mechanics - bring your own Lagrangians/Hamiltonians
  and let heyoka formulate and solve the equations of motion,
* builtin support for high-order variational equations - compute not only the solution,
  but also its partial derivatives,
* builtin support for machine learning applications via neural network models,
* the ability to maintain machine precision accuracy over
  tens of billions of timesteps,
* batch mode integration to harness the power of modern
  [SIMD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SIMD) instruction sets
  (including AVX/AVX2/AVX-512/Neon/VSX),
* ensemble simulations and automatic parallelisation.

If you prefer using Python rather than C++, heyoka can be used from Python via
[heyoka.py](https://github.com/bluescarni/heyoka.py), its Python bindings.

If you are using heyoka as part of your research, teaching, or other activities, we would be grateful if you could star
the repository and/or cite our work. For citation purposes, you can use the following BibTex entry, which refers

Quick example
-------------

As a simple example, here's how the ODE system of the
[pendulum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pendulum_(mathematics))
is defined and numerically integrated
in heyoka:

```c++
#include <iostream>

#include <heyoka/heyoka.hpp>

using namespace heyoka;

int main()
{
    // Create the symbolic variables x and v.
    auto [x, v] = make_vars("x", "v");

    // Create the integrator object
    // in double precision.
    auto ta = taylor_adaptive<double>{// Definition of the ODE system:
                                      // x' = v
                                      // v' = -9.8 * sin(x)
                                      {prime(x) = v, prime(v) = -9.8 * sin(x)},
                                      // Initial conditions
                                      // for x and v.
                                      {0.05, 0.025}};

    // Integrate for 10 time units.
    ta.propagate_for(10.);

    // Print the state vector.
    std::cout << "x(10) = " << ta.get_state()[0] << '\n';
    std::cout << "v(10) = " << ta.get_state()[1] << '\n';
}
```

Output:

```console
x(10) = 0.0487397
y(10) = 0.0429423
```
